Our IT company embarked on an ambitious project in January 2024 aimed at delivering
a cutting-edge software solution to our users and clients. The project was meticulously
planned with a target launch date of June 1. However, as the deadline approaches,
it becomes apparent that several tasks are still in progress, and there are unresolved
bugs that need attention. The testing process, crucial for ensuring product quality,
has not yet begun. As a software engineer involved in the project, what aspects could
have been handled better to prevent the delays and issues experienced, such as incomplete
tasks, unresolved bugs, and a delayed testing process?

For this activity, evaluate the situation and offer your suggestions on areas
where improvements could have been made.

Answer: The team should have a daily or weekly meetings for their updates,
by doing so, this will foster open communication and collaboration among the
team members, stakeholders, and clients. Regularly communicate progress, challenges
and changes to timelines or requirements. And for the one who is managing the team,
they should know all potential risks and uncertainties early in the project and develop
mitigation strategies to address them, and always remind everyone for the deadlines.
Everyone should Prioritize and Focus, meaning prioritizing the task based on their
importance.
