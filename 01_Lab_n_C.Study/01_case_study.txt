CASE STUDY 1:

As an experienced professional in the software industry, you are currently employed at a 
company that has developed its own software solution, integrating various 
third-party software components. Recently, your team encountered a 
significant challenge with one of your third-party software providers. 
The provider notified you that they would cease support for your current implementation
and required you to upgrade your codebase to align with their new implementation standards.

This unexpected development prompted your team to reflect on your
processes and consider preventive measures to mitigate similar challenges
in the future. While this issue primarily concerns the third-party software
provider, it raises questions about your approach to software integration
and dependency management.


QUESTION:

How can you improve your communication and relationship with third-party
software providers to stay informed about upcoming changes or updates?

ANSWER:

We should have a daily or maybe weekly meeting, so that we can stay in touch, and by doing so we are establishing much
stronger connection. And even if we don't have planned meeting, don't wait for the problem
to arise, we can already asked or look at their progress and communicate to the providers.
